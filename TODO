VM AUTOMATION
- edit /etc/nsswitch.conf adding libvirt in hosts line
- netplan IP addresses integrated with ansible
(can initially ssh with hostname and other IP addr -> need default
hostname initially)
- change hostname later via ansible
- autostart
- add hostname to /etc/hosts in the server
- SDE install should also be automatic....
- add ssh keys?
- DHCP server ?

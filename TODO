VM AUTOMATION

- check if P4 Studio is installed (or install otehrwise) in bootstrap role
- DHCP server / netplan IP addresses integrated with ansible 
- remove vm should be also be Ansible based.... (need to delete qcow2 file)

P4:

- p4-build: add CMake options, add -c clean option

- update README : use ubuntu on bastion

- fix server, delete zhihaow account

- service runs as root ...why? ssh keys should be geenrated for root...
